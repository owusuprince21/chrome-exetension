# chrome-exetension
 I build this simple chrome extension which allow users to save URLs for future referrence
 Any user can save the URLs by
 1. Entering the URLs into the field and clicking on the "SAVE INPUT" button or
 2. By clicking on the "SAVE TAB" button to trigger the targeted chrome address bar or active tab URL


You can save unlimited URLs on this extention and visiting it later by clicking on the prefer URL
Also you can delete all the URLs by clicking on the "DELETE" button
